# Breaking down problems in code
## planning

Before we start coding, we can look at the problem we wish to create and breakdown it down into smaller parts. By doing this we can take a large project and turn it into smaller tasks or questions that we need answering.

### Example 1.
> Create a website business card where clicking on different links will allow the user to call, email or find a map.

Lets presume we know how to make a basic website using HTML and CSS, but perhaps we don't know how to make the links work as described. Our breakdown list of tasks might be as follows.

- Design basic layout of the website using pen and paper
- Code layout using HTML and CSS
- ? Research how to make links call, email and bring up a map ?
- Implement research into code

## Task / question list

It is often tempting, especially when you're excited to get started on a project, to dive straight in and start coding. Sometime this is fine: when you have thought through before-hand what is required for the project to function. However, it can often be of benefit to first think about each element of the project or problem and create a task list. This will allow you to see what you do or don't know about the problem area and how it should be solved.

The idea here is to try and save yourself time in the long-run by identifying issues you may face within production and trying to mitigate the blockages before reaching them.

- ? I don't know how to make this element ?

At this point you can research or experiment how an issue could work â€“ then either start the project as you have found a possible solution, keep researching other solutions, or find that your project is not possible in it's current form.


### Example 2.
> Create a robot that can follow green colours

- ? Robot needs to be able to follow and identify green ?
-- let's give it a micro-computer as it's "brain" decision making center
- ? Robot needs to "follow" ?
-- lets give it wheels and motors
- ? Robot needs to see colours ?
-- ? let's try using a small camera and computing the colour information ?
---  On test: averaging the pixel colour information every tenth frame gave the best performance.

## Tasks work well with others

Lastly, breaking down you project into tasks and questions allows you to more easily distribute the work load to other people. By clearly listing what the project requires it can help you collaborate.

### Example 3.
> Create pong

- Create a player
-- keep track of their position
- Keep track of score
- Create ball
-- keep track of position
-- add score to player if ball passes over opposite players goal
- Add input controls for players
-- ? test with friend what input is the most fun ?
--- on test using a Makey Makey attached to 4 giant buttons, 2 for each player was the most fun.
- Add start, restart and game over screens
